Sulfurous was created by Mittagskogel and is based off Phosphorus, which was created by Nathan Dinsmore. Its CPS-style compilation and overall design was inspired by Rhys Simpson's sb2.js. It would have more bugs if not for Truman Kilen. It uses the JSZip library, created by Stuart Knightley, David Duponchel, Franz Buchinger, and Ant√≥nio Afonso, to read .sb2 files and compressed projects, and the canvg library, created by Gabe Lerner, to render SVGs in <canvas> elements.
