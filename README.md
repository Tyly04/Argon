phosphorus was created by Nathan. Its CPS-style compilation and overall design was inspired by Rhys's sb2.js. It would have more bugs if not for Truman and Tim. It uses the JSZip library, created by Stuart Knightley, David Duponchel, Franz Buchinger, and Ant√≥nio Afonso, to read .sb2 files and compressed projects, and the canvg library, created by Gabe Lerner, to render SVGs in <canvas> elements.
